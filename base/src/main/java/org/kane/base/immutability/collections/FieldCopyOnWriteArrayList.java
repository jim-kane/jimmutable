/**
 * An implementation of a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} that begins life as mutable
 * but can, at any time, be "{@link #freeze() frozen}" (made immutable). In other
 * words, a wrapper for a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} that implements {@link Field}.
 * 
 * <p>Why does one need a thread safe immutable list? Well... if your
 * <em>construction</em> code (when the object is mutable) is threaded then it is
 * <em>much</em> safer to use a concurrent backing store. In Java, it is nigh
 * impossible to guarantee the mutable -> immutable transition in a multi-threaded
 * context absent a concurrent backing store.
 * 
 * <p>In general, however (when the field is being created in single threaded code),
 * just use {@link FieldArrayList}, which is <em>far</em> faster to construct.
